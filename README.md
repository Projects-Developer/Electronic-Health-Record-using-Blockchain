## Abstract:
The traditional Electronic Health Record (EHR) system faces challenges related to security, interoperability, and patient data ownership. This study proposes a blockchain-based EHR system that utilizes decentralized storage, encryption, and smart contracts to ensure secure, interoperable, and patient-centric management of EHRs. The proposed system enables patients to control their medical information, ensures seamless data sharing between healthcare providers, and maintains an immutable audit trail. The blockchain-based EHR system has the potential to transform the healthcare industry by prioritizing patient data security, interoperability, and patient-centricity.

Keywords: Electronic Health Record (EHR), Blockchain, Decentralized Storage, Smart Contracts, Patient-Centricity, Interoperability, Security.
